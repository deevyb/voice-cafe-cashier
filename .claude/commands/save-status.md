Save all session progress so the next session can continue seamlessly.

## Steps

1. **Check git status** — Run `git status` to see what's changed

2. **Update CLAUDE.md** with:
   - "Last Updated" date
   - Current phase/route statuses
   - "What To Do Next Session" with specific actionable steps
   - Any decisions made or pending blockers

3. **Update TECHNICAL.md** (only if schema, API, or architecture changed)

4. **Commit and push** — Single commit with message summarizing the session's work

## Output

End with a brief summary table:

- What was accomplished
- What's next
- Any uncommitted changes or blockers

Do NOT ask for confirmation — just execute all steps and report results.
