# Project Status — Always Read First

At the start of every conversation, read the file `.claude/rules/status.md` to understand:
- What steps are complete
- What's being worked on right now
- What's next
- Any blockers or pending decisions

Also read `PLAN.md` in the project root for the full implementation plan.

This is the **single source of truth** for project status, shared between Cursor and Claude Code.

## Save-Status Snapshot (Mirror)

- Last Updated: February 14, 2026
- Current phase: Step 4 in-progress (M1+M2 done, M3 pending), Step 5 pending, Step 7 pending
- Latest change: Aligned voice prompt with stored prompt rules, added deterministic drink defaults/syrup normalization, switched voice model default to gpt-realtime, and cleaned debug instrumentation after verification
- Immediate next actions:
  1. Step 4 M3: Voice order finalization, error handling, polish
  2. Step 5: Rebrand UI from Delo to NYC cafe system
  3. Step 7: Upgrade owner dashboard metrics/charts
- Blockers: none

## Cursor + Claude Code Switching Protocol (Required)

- Treat this repository as a **dual-tool workflow**: work may continue in either Cursor or Claude Code at any time.
- Do not create alternate status trackers. Use only `.claude/rules/status.md` for session handoff.
- Before implementing, confirm current step and blockers from `.claude/rules/status.md`.
- After meaningful progress, update `.claude/rules/status.md` with:
  - completed work,
  - what is in-progress,
  - explicit next actions for the next session.
- Keep `PLAN.md` aligned with execution order; use it as canonical implementation plan.
- Prefer incremental, handoff-friendly changes with clear notes so the next tool session can resume immediately.

When ending a session where meaningful progress was made, update `.claude/rules/status.md` to reflect what changed — so the next session (in either tool) picks up seamlessly.
