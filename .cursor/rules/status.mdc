# Project Status — Always Read First

At the start of every conversation, read the file `.claude/rules/status.md` to understand:
- What routes/features are complete
- What's being worked on right now
- What's next
- Any blockers or pending decisions

This is the **single source of truth** for project status, shared between Cursor and Claude Code.

When ending a session where meaningful progress was made, update `.claude/rules/status.md` to reflect what changed — so the next session (in either tool) picks up seamlessly.
