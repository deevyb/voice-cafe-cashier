# Save Session Status

When asked to save status or wrap up, follow these steps:

## Steps

1. **Check git status** — Run `git status` to see what's changed

2. **Update `.claude/rules/status.md` and `.cursor/rules/status.mdc`** with:
   - "Last Updated" date (today's date)
   - Current step statuses (pending/in-progress/complete)
   - "What's Next" with specific actionable steps
   - Any blockers or pending decisions

3. **Update `TECHNICAL.md`** only if schema, API, or architecture changed

4. **Commit and push** — Single commit with message summarizing the session's work

## Output

End with a brief summary:
- What was accomplished
- What's next
- Any uncommitted changes or blockers

Do NOT ask for confirmation — just execute all steps and report results.
