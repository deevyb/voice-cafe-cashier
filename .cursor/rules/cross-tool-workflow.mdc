# Cross-Tool Development Workflow

This project is intentionally developed across Cursor and Claude Code. Every session must preserve seamless handoff.

## Required Handoff Behavior

- Read `.claude/rules/status.md` and `PLAN.md` at session start.
- Continue from the current in-progress step unless the user explicitly reprioritizes.
- Update `.claude/rules/status.md` whenever meaningful progress is made.
- Keep notes concrete: what changed, what is pending, exact next step.
- Do not create new parallel workflow docs when existing ones already define status and plan.

## Source of Truth

- Status: `.claude/rules/status.md`
- Plan: `PLAN.md`
- Project guide: `CLAUDE.md`
