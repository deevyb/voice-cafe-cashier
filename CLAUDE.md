# Delo Coffee Kiosk - Project Guide

## Who I'm Building For

**Owner:** Non-technical founder who knows exactly what they want — and wants to understand what's being built. They don't need to make technical decisions, but they want to be an informed partner who learns along the way.

**Communication Rules:**

- Explain technical concepts in plain, accessible language — like talking to a smart friend who doesn't work in tech
- Use judgment on what's worth explaining — focus on meaningful learning moments, not every tiny choice
- When a decision has real trade-offs, share the options, implications, and my recommendation
- Make real-world implications clear: "This means the app will load faster" not "This reduces bundle size"
- **Always pause for manual testing before committing** — ask owner to test, wait for confirmation
- The goal is education and transparency, not overwhelm

---

## Context Preservation (Important!)

This project uses documentation as persistent memory across Claude Code sessions. Auto-compaction and session breaks can lose context, so **these docs are the source of truth**.

### At Session Start

1. Read this entire file (CLAUDE.md)
2. Check the **Current Status** section (bottom of this file) for what's done and what's next
3. If needed, read TECHNICAL.md for implementation details

### At Meaningful Milestones — Update Docs Before Stopping

**What counts as a milestone:**

- Completing a major feature or screen
- Finishing setup/infrastructure work
- Making significant architectural decisions
- Any stopping point where context would be lost

**What to update:**

1. **CLAUDE.md → Current Status section** — Update route statuses, what's done, what's next
2. **TECHNICAL.md** — If any technical details changed (schema, deployment, etc.)
3. **Commit and push** — So updates survive and are visible on GitHub

### Quick Status Update Template

When updating the Current Status section, include:

- Which routes/features are complete vs. in-progress vs. pending
- Any blockers or decisions that need user input
- What the next session should pick up on

## The Business

**Delo Coffee** runs pop-up coffee events 1-2 times per month, serving 100-150 customers per event. Currently using paper order cards where customers circle their choices — it works, but cards get lost or shuffled during busy periods.

**The Problem:** Physical cards get mixed up, leading to order mistakes and confusion about whose drink is whose.

**The Solution:** iPad-based ordering system where customers tap their order, it appears instantly on the kitchen display in perfect order, and nothing can get lost or shuffled.

---

## The Brand

Delo Coffee is inspired by the _delo_ — a traditional Indian courtyard where strangers become friends and everyone belongs. The brand is:

- **Warm & cozy** — like being welcomed into someone's home
- **Playful** — not stuffy or pretentious
- **Heritage-rooted** — honors tradition without being dated

**Colors:**

- Maroon: `#921C12` (primary accent)
- Cream: `#F9F6EE` (backgrounds)
- Dark Navy: `#000024` (text)
- Terracotta: `#C85A2E` (supporting warmth)

**Typography:**

- Yatra One — page title ("Delo Coffee")
- Bricolage Grotesque — drink names, category headers, buttons
- Cooper Md BT Medium — modifier labels (Milk, Temperature, Your Name)
- Manrope — modifier options (Regular, Oat, Hot, Iced), input text
- Roboto Mono — descriptions, details

**Design Principles:**

- Generous white space (like the open courtyard)
- Large tap targets (60x60pt minimum)
- Natural, warm aesthetic
- No generic "café app" look

---

## The Menu

**Current drinks (editable from admin):**

| Drink             | Milk Options | Temperature Options |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Elaichi Latte     | Regular, Oat | Hot, Iced           |
| Ginger Slap Latte | Regular, Oat | Hot, Iced           |
| Tubo Latte        | Regular, Oat | Hot, Iced           |
| Latte             | Regular, Oat | Hot, Iced           |
| Cortado           | Regular, Oat | —                   |
| Macchiato         | —            | —                   |
| Espresso          | —            | —                   |

**Milk options:** Regular, Oat (binary choice)
**Temperature options:** Hot, Iced (binary choice)

## The Experience

### Customer Flow (`/order`)

1. See all drinks as a clean grid (no photos for now — elegant text cards)
2. Tap a drink → see applicable modifier options
3. Select modifiers (pre-selected defaults)
4. Enter name (required)
5. Tap "Send"
6. See confirmation with their full order: e.g. "Sarah: Elaichi Latte, Oat Milk, Iced"
7. Screen auto-resets after 3 seconds

### Kitchen Flow (`/kitchen`)

1. Orders appear in real-time, oldest first
2. Each card shows: customer name, drink, modifiers, time since ordered
3. Show counts: "Placed: 5 | Ready: 12"
4. Tap card → "Mark Ready" or "Cancel"
5. Ready orders accumulate in separate section (no need to clear)

### Admin Flow (`/admin`)

1. Enter passcode (owner chooses their own)
2. Four tabs:
   - **Menu Items:** Toggle drinks on/off, edit modifiers per item
   - **Modifiers:** Add/edit/delete milk and temperature options
   - **Dashboard:** Order stats and analytics
   - **Export:** Download CSV of orders by date range

---

## Critical Requirements

### Must-Haves

- **Stability above all** — biggest fear is crashes/freezes during rush
- **Beautiful, silky animations** — Framer Motion-style polish throughout
- **Real-time sync** — orders appear instantly on kitchen display
- **Fully editable menu** — nothing hardcoded, everything from admin
- **iPad landscape only** — optimized for this single use case
- **Offline resilience** — graceful handling if WiFi hiccups

### Nice-to-Haves (Later)

- Search/filter on kitchen display
- Drink photos
- More modifier categories

### Out of Scope

- Payments, prices, or totals
- Order numbers or verbal callouts
- Multi-item orders or carts
- Customer accounts or login
- Complex analytics or dashboards

---

## Timeline

**Deadline:** Less than 2 weeks for upcoming pop-up event

**Setup:**

- One iPad for customer ordering
- One iPad/display for kitchen
- 2-person team (owner + helper)
- WiFi usually reliable at venues

---

## When to Involve the Owner

**Explain and educate when:**

- Making a meaningful technical choice that has real trade-offs worth understanding
- The decision affects what they'll see, feel, or experience
- It's a good learning moment that helps them understand how the app works
- They'd benefit from knowing why something is built a certain way

**Just handle it when:**

- It's a routine technical choice with an obvious right answer
- The decision is purely implementation detail with no user-facing impact
- Explaining it would add complexity without adding understanding

**When presenting decisions:**

- Explain in plain language what each option means
- Make the real-world implications clear
- Give a clear recommendation with reasoning
- Make it easy to say "go with your recommendation" — but also easy to ask questions

---

## Using Specialized Plugins

Two plugins are installed that can help with certain tasks. **Proactively suggest these when they'd add value, and explain why.**

### `/frontend-design`

**What it does:** Generates polished, creative UI components with high design quality.

**When to suggest it:**

- Building a new screen or component from scratch where visual creativity matters
- When the owner wants to see multiple design directions
- For UI that needs extra polish beyond the established patterns

**When NOT to use it:** For incremental changes to existing components, or when following established design patterns.

### `/feature-dev`

**What it does:** Deep codebase analysis before implementation — maps architecture, traces dependencies, plans multi-file changes.

**When to suggest it:**

- Starting a major new route (`/kitchen`, `/admin`)
- Features that touch many files or require understanding the whole system
- Complex features where architectural planning prevents mistakes

**When NOT to use it:** For focused, single-component work or when the scope is already clear.

---

## Success Criteria

The owner will know this project succeeded when:

1. They get through their next pop-up with zero lost orders
2. The app never crashes or freezes during the rush
3. Customers find it intuitive (no explanation needed)
4. It looks and feels like a natural extension of Delo's brand
5. Every interaction feels smooth and polished

## Key Design Decisions Made

### Animation Style (Reference: Superpower.com, Netflix iOS, landonorris.com)

**Entrance Animation (Option B - Coordinated Fade-Slide):**

- Custom easing curve: `[0.65, 0.05, 0, 1]` (smooth deceleration)
- Cards slide up 40px while fading in
- 70ms stagger between cards
- Duration: 0.5s

**Press Effect (Option B - Press-In):**

- Scale to 0.97
- Move down 2px (pressing "into" screen)
- Shadow reduces on press
- Spring physics: stiffness 400, damping 30 (minimal bounce)

**Customization Screen (Square-style modal):**

- **Layout:** Floating modal panel over softly dimmed menu grid (no blur)
- **Transition:** Slide-up + fade-in
- **Close:** Both X button in corner AND backdrop tap to close
- **Animation:** Spring physics (stiffness 400, damping 30) for snappy, minimal-bounce feel
- **Corner radius:** `rounded-xl` (matches drink cards)

### Typography System (Updated January 4, 2026)

| Element                  | Font        | Weight   | Size             |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Page title "Delo Coffee" | Yatra One   | 400      | 48px (text-5xl)  |
| Category headers         | Bricolage   | SemiBold | 16px (text-base) |
| Drink names (cards)      | Bricolage   | SemiBold | 24px (text-2xl)  |
| Drink name (modal)       | Bricolage   | Bold     | 36px (text-4xl)  |
| Modifier labels          | Cooper      | Medium   | 14px (text-sm)   |
| Modifier buttons         | Manrope     | SemiBold | 18px (text-lg)   |
| Descriptions             | Roboto Mono | Regular  | 16px (text-base) |

### Menu Categories

- **Signature:** Elaichi Latte, Ginger Slap Latte, Tubo Latte
- **Classics:** Latte, Cortado, Macchiato, Espresso
- Stored in `category` column on `menu_items` table

### Shared CSS Classes (in globals.css)

To prevent styling inconsistencies, common patterns are defined once:

**Text & Labels:**
- `.label-modifier` — Modifier labels (Milk, Temperature, Your Name)
- `.text-modifier-option` — Text inside modifier buttons and name input (Manrope SemiBold 18px)
- `.text-description` — Small descriptive text

**Buttons:**
- `.btn-primary` — Maroon submit buttons, h-16 (with disabled state)
- `.btn-secondary` — Cancel buttons, h-12, gray background
- `.btn-modal-action` — Modal save/create buttons, h-12, maroon

**Form Elements:**
- `.input-form` — Standard form input (h-16, rounded-xl, consistent border)
- `.select-form` — Dropdown select with same styling
- `.checkbox-form` — Checkbox input styling
- `.checkbox-label` — Checkbox row wrapper with hover effect

**Modal Elements:**
- `.modal-title` — Modal header (h2, text-2xl, maroon)
- `.modal-description` — Subtitle text below title
- `.error-banner` — Error message display

**State:**
- `.item-unavailable` — 50% opacity for sold-out/inactive items

### Shared Modal Component (Added January 4, 2026)

All form modals now use a shared `Modal.tsx` component that provides:
- Consistent backdrop (bg-delo-navy/40, click-to-close)
- Panel styling (bg-delo-cream, rounded-xl, shadow-2xl, p-8)
- X close button with hover animation
- Framer Motion spring animations (stiffness 400, damping 30)
- Configurable size prop (sm, md, lg)

Modals using this component:
- `DrinkCustomizer` (customer order page)
- `NewMenuItemForm` (admin create menu item)
- `ModifierForm` (admin add/edit modifier)
- `MenuItemEditor` (admin edit item modifiers)

The cancel confirmation modal in KitchenClient intentionally stays distinct (different styling for different context).

### Sold-Out Item Display (Added January 4, 2025)

When items are toggled OFF in admin, they now appear on `/order` with:

- 50% opacity (faded look)
- "Sold Out" maroon pill badge in top-right corner
- Tap disabled (no interaction)
- Cursor shows not-allowed

This keeps items visible so customers know what's normally available.

### Unavailable Modifier Display (Added January 5, 2025)

When modifier options are toggled OFF in admin, they appear in the customizer modal:

- Faded button with dashed border
- "Sold Out" label below button (maroon, semibold)
- Auto-selects first available option if default is unavailable
- If ALL options in a category are unavailable, customer can still submit (no selection required)

This follows UX best practice: disable rather than hide, so customers see what's normally available.

## What To Do Next Session

1. Read this file (CLAUDE.md)
2. **Visual Personality — Pick a Direction:**
   - Three layout options were explored (see below)
   - Owner needs to pick one (or mix elements)
   - Then implement the chosen direction

**Visual Direction Options (Explored January 4, 2026):**

| Option | Name | Feel | Key Features |
|--------|------|------|--------------|
| A | The Courtyard | Warm, structured | Category "zones" with borders, corner ribbons on cards, framed confirmation |
| B | Playful Pop | Fun, delightful | Drink icons (cardamom, ginger, etc.), floating sections, confetti confirmation |
| C | Editorial Elegance | Refined, confident | Left-aligned header, vertical category labels, typography-focused, asymmetric |

**All options keep:** Brand colors (maroon, cream, navy, terracotta), fonts (Yatra, Bricolage, Cooper, Manrope), existing animations.

**Decision needed:** Which direction resonates most? Or mix elements from different options?

---

**Health Check Completed (January 4, 2026):**

- Fixed documentation dates and accuracy
- Added `.env.example` for easier onboarding
- Added stats API documentation to TECHNICAL.md
- Fixed README doc paths
- Standardized API error handling
- Removed outdated Known Issues (CSV bug was already fixed)

**New Features Added Previously (January 5, 2026):**

- **Dashboard Stats UI** — Full statistics display in admin Dashboard tab
  - Today + All-Time order counts with status breakdown (placed/ready/canceled)
  - Popular Drinks list (top 20, scrollable)
  - Modifier Preferences with visual progress bars (dynamic categories)
  - Loading skeleton and error handling
- **Stats API** — `GET /api/admin/stats` endpoint
  - Returns aggregated order counts, popular drinks, modifier breakdown
  - `force-dynamic` for fresh data on every request
- **Server-Side Modifier Defaults** — Orders API now applies drink defaults
  - If an order is missing modifiers, the drink's default_modifiers are applied
  - Ensures data integrity for analytics
- **Data Backfill** — Fixed historical order missing temperature

**Files Changed:**

- `app/api/admin/stats/route.ts` — NEW: Stats aggregation endpoint
- `app/api/orders/route.ts` — Added server-side modifier defaults
- `components/DashboardSection.tsx` — Full rewrite with stats UI + modular subcomponents
- `lib/supabase.ts` — Added DashboardStats, OrderCounts, DrinkCount, ModifierOption types

**Blockers:** None
